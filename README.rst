including the modules you want, and create an apk including python, libs, and
your application.

The gnuradio branch contains recipes to build gnuradio applications for android.
You can even build Android packages from python code generated by grc.


Global overview
---------------

#. Download Android NDK, SDK
 
#. Launch "android", and download latest Android platform

#. Export some environment variables::

    export ANDROIDSDK=<path/to/android-sdk>"
    export ANDROIDNDK="/path/to/android-ndk>"
    export ANDROIDNDKVER=r10            # This version I tested against
    export ANDROIDAPI=21                # I tested against

 (Of course correct the paths mentioned in ANDROIDSDK and ANDROIDNDK)

#. Clone python-for-android::

    git clone git://github.com/dl1ksv/python-for-android
    git checkout gnuradio

#. Build a gnuradio distribution ::

    cd python-for-android
    ./distribute.sh -m "audiostream gnuradio tinyalsa osmosdr kivy" -C -d gnuradio 
 
 After some cups of tea you should find a build.py in the directory
  dist/gnuradio

#. Go to gnuradio-examples/scripts directory::
    There you'll find some scripts to build some examples.
    
    #. build_dialtone.sh
    

#. Install the debug apk to your device::

    adb install ../../dist/gnuradio/bin/Dialtone-1.0-debug.apk

#. Enjoy.
